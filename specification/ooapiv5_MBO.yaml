This project uses the \"nl-test-admin\" consumer \n<br/>\n<figure>\n\t<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"OOAPIv5_model.png\">\n  <img src=\"OOAPIv5_model.png\" alt=\"OOAPI information model that feeds OOAPI specification\" width=\"70%\" class=\"img-responsive\">\n  </a>\n  <figcaption> OOAPI information model that feeds OOAPI specification (click to enlage)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThe model provides an overview of how the objects on which the API is specified are related. The overarching concept educations is not found in the in the end points of the API. The smaller concepts of programOffering, courseOffering and conceptOffering are all found in the offering endpoint. The different types of association can all be found in the association endpoint.\n\nThe original file for this model can be found <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"OOAPIv5_model_v0.4.drawio\">here</a>\n\nThe program relations object is not found as a separate endpoint but relations between programs can be found within the program endpoint by expanding that endpoint.\n\nInformation about earlier meetings and presentations can be found <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/open-education-api/notulen\">here</a>\n\nInformation on the EDU-API model that was also used for this api is shown <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"eduapi.png\">here</a>\n"

    description: |
      The associations API provides information about the association between an offering and a person (e.g. students, lecturers, etc).
      Associations can be posted between institutions This requires information details on the offering and the persons.
      To allow for this information a complete person object and offering object can be part of the API.
      The structure is explained in the following model:
      <table>
        <tr>
         <td></td>
         <td colspan=3 align=center>offering</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
         <td rowspan=3>student</td>
         <td></td>
         <!-- <td>internal</td>
         -->
         <td>external</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
         <td>internal</td>
         <!-- <td>POST <a href="#tag/offerings/paths/~1offerings~1{offeringId}~1associations~1external/post">/offerings/{offeringId}/associations/me</a> local enrollment based on selected offering
          This call will allow for a local student using his .wellknown credentials to enroll for the offering identified by the offeringId
          <br>Alternatively the association can also be created through POST <a href="#tag/associations/paths/~1associations~1me/post">/associations/me</a>
         </td>
         -->
         <td>POST <a href="#tag/associations/paths/~1associations~1external~1me/post">/associations/external/me</a> gets student details from .wellknown at home institution. It passes offering details (provided by external institution) to the home institution so the home institution can create a placeholder for the offering and its results.
         </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
         <td>external</td>
          <!--
          <td>
          This method is not yet implemented it requires full student details and offering details. This would mean the
          OOAPI message would contain more than one resource in the message. At the moment the student mobility project is looking into
          a sollution.
          <br> Alternatively it could be achieved through using two calls:
          <ul>
           <li>create student with POST <a href="#tag/persons/paths/~1persons~1{personId}/post">/persons</a></li>
           <li><a href="#tag/offerings/paths/~1offerings~1{offeringId}~1associations~1external/post">/offerings/{offeringId}/associations/me</a></li>
          </ul>
          for the enrollment
         </td>
          -->
         <td>no support needed</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      Direct update of current information: <a href="#tag/associations/paths/~1associations~1{associationId}/patch"> PATCH /associations/{associationId}</a>
      This call is currently limited to passing results and a remote state. For future use other association resource information could be passed.

  - name: components
    description: The components API provides information about components being part of parent courses.
  - name: groups
    description: The groups API provides information about groups that are related to organizations, persons and offerings. Groups of students that are related to an offering are typically used for rostering. The rostering application assigns students based on these groups. For example, class 1b will be assigned to the course offering on monday morning. Not all groups are related to an offering. A group of people can also be a team that is working on a task outside the OOAPI scope. These can be teams of students, but also teams of employees.
  - name: offerings
    description: The offerings API provides information about offerings which have a global timeframe, e.g. a period to which students can enroll.

                                    value: As with all empirical sciences, to assure valid outcomes, HCI studies heavily rely on research methods and statistics. This holds for the design of user interfaces, personalized recommender systems, and interaction paradigms for the internet of things. This course prepares you to do so by learning you to collect data, design experiments, and analyze the results. By the end of the course, you will have a detailed understanding of how to select and apply quantitative research methods and analysis to address virtually all HCI challenges. Quantitative research and data analysis will be taught in the context of state-of-the-art HCI challenges. Lectures will be alternated with hands-on learning, including work with predefined datasets (e.g., addressing facial features, cognitive load, and emotion). Additionally, students will set up their own research (e.g., using eye tracking). Data processing and analysis will be executed using R.
